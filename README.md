## My process

- The project details and files were gotten from [Front-end Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)
- I read the README file before starting the project, there I got directives on how to work out the challange.
- Afterwards, I wrote the HTML first then created a separate style sheet for my CSS.
- I used Figma to get the best judgement for margins, paddings and width.
- The Mobile View was styled first, then I used CSS media query to make it responsive.
- Functionality is then added with Vanilla JavaScript

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first Workflow
- JavaScript
- JavaScript Functions
- JavaScript DOM

### What I learned

From this project, I've been able to learn the approach to reproducing a UI/UX design and how to better handle a project.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to be able to combine my HTML and CSS knowledge with JavaScript to be able to build a flexible, responsive, functional and interactive websites, landing pages, blogs and a Portfolio for myself.

### Useful resources

- [Figma.com](https://figma.com) - This helped me to get the best judgement for font-size, margin, padding, width and border-radius. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
